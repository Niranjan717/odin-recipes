	<p>Ayam Bakar is a popular Indonesian grilled chicken dish, known for its smoky flavor and aromatic spices. It is often served with rice and a side of sambal for an extra kick.</p>
	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>1 whole chicken, cut into pieces</li>
		<li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
		<li>2 shallots, minced</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
		<li>1 tablespoon tamarind paste</li>
		<li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon cumin powder</li>
		<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
		<li>Fresh lime leaves (optional, for garnish)</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Instructions</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>In a large bowl, combine minced garlic, shallots, soy sauce, tamarind paste, brown sugar, turmeric, coriander, cumin, salt, and pepper. Mix well to create a marinade.</li>
		<li>Add the chicken pieces to the marinade, ensuring they are well coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight for better flavor.</li>
		<li>Preheat your grill or barbecue to medium-high heat.</li>
		<li>Remove the chicken from the marinade, allowing excess marinade to drip off. Brush the chicken pieces with vegetable oil to prevent sticking.</li>
		<li>Place the chicken on the grill and cook for about 15-20 minutes on each side, or until the chicken is cooked through and has a nice char. Baste with any remaining marinade during grilling for added flavor.</li>
		<li>Once cooked, remove the chicken from the grill and let it rest for a few minutes.</li>
		<li>Serve hot, garnished with fresh lime leaves if desired. It pairs well with steamed rice and a side of sambal for those who enjoy a spicy kick.</li>
	</ol>
